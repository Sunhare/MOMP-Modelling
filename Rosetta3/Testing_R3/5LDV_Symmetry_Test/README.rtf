\f0\fs24 \cf0 Notes for later me:\
This was a really hard challenge but eventually I pulled it off\
\
As a trial run I used 5LDV (a trimeric beta barrel) to generate a symdef file\
\
Code for symdef file generation\
Trial Symdef File: (C3 for 5ldv)\

\f1\i ~/Downloads/rosetta_src_2018.33.60351_bundle//main/source/src/apps/public/symmetry/make_symmdef_file.pl -m NCS -a A -i B -p inputs/5ldv_sym.pdb > C3_5ldv.symdef
\f0\i0 \
\
	A key realization was when I realized for a trimer there's only 1 other symmetric subunit (instead of -i B C I only did -i B and it worked)\

^This is my reference\
\

\f2\b \ul Steps to generate symdef file:
\f0\b0 \ulnone \
1. Make a pdb file with all chains labeled uniquely of fully symmetric protein complex\
	Make sure when you make it, it's untranslated relative to the monomer you want to symmetrize\
2. Run above code (Code for symdef file) to generate the symdef file \
\
3. Run this code using the new symdef file \
$ROSETTA3/bin/score_jd2.default.macosclangrelease @inputs/options_5LDV \
\
Common errors include files being in the wrong directory, and -overwrite not being passed if the files already exist\
